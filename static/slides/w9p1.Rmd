## {shinydashboard}
[Getting started](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/get_started.html)

---
# Most basic dashboard

```{r eval = FALSE}
## app.R ##
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)

ui <- dashboardPage(
  dashboardHeader(),
  dashboardSidebar(),
  dashboardBody()
)

server <- function(input, output) { }

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

---
# Looks like this

.center[
![](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/images/blank_dashboard.png)
]

---
# First dashboard - ui

Follow along!

```{r dashboard1-ui, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)

ui <- dashboardPage(
  dashboardHeader(title = "Basic dashboard"),
  
  dashboardSidebar(),
  
  dashboardBody(
    # Boxes need to be put in a row (or column)
    fluidRow(
      box(plotOutput("plot1", height = 250)),

      box(
        title = "Controls",
        sliderInput("slider", "Number of observations:", 1, 100, 50)
      )
    )
  )
  
)
```

---
# First dashboard - server

```{r dashboard1-server, eval = FALSE}
server <- function(input, output) {
  set.seed(122)
  histdata <- rnorm(500)

  output$plot1 <- renderPlot({
    data <- histdata[seq_len(input$slider)]
    hist(data)
  })
}
```

--
### Run it

```{r, run-dashboard, eval = FALSE}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

[demo]

---
# Main differences
* You now have `dashboardSidebar` and `dashboardBody`

* You also now have `fluidRow` and `box` arguments to arrange things in the main
body


---
# Sidebar
* Probably the defining characteristic of the dashboard

  + Define a `sidebarMenu` with `menuItem`s


--
### Example

```{r sidebar, eval = FALSE}
sidebarMenu(
  menuItem("Histogram", tabName = "histo", icon = icon("chart-bar")),
  menuItem("Bin Counts", tabName = "bins", icon = icon("table"))
)
```

You can also do things like put the slider in the `sidebarMenu`

[demo]

---
# Referencing menu items

* If you define `menuItem`s, you'll have to give them a `tabName` (see previous
slide).

* In the `dashboardBody`, create a `tabItems` with specific `tabItem` pieces.
  This should be how you control/refer to the `menuItem`.


[demo]

---
# Put slider in sidebar

In this case, it's less than ideal to have the slider separated.

Instead, we can put it right in the sidebar

Bonus - it can then control things across tabs

[demo]

---
# Increase readability
* As I've mentioned, shiny apps can become unreadable quickly


--
Consider creating objects for each piece, possibly even in separate R files.

---
# Example

```{r eval = FALSE}
sidebar <- dashboardSidebar(
  sidebarMenu(
    menuItem("Histogram", tabName = "histo", icon = icon("chart-bar")),
    sliderInput("slider", "Number of observations:", 1, 100, 50)
  )
)

body <- dashboardBody(
  fluidRow(
    tabItems(
      tabItem(
        "histo",
        box(plotOutput("plot1", height = 250))
      )
    )
  )
)
```

---
# UI part

```{r eval = FALSE}
ui <- dashboardPage(
  dashboardHeader(title = "Basic dashboard"),
  sidebar,
  body
)
```

--
Note you could create intermediary objects within each of the `sidebar` and `body` parts as well.

---
# Extension

* There's lots of extensions for shiny, and quite a few (but not as many) for shinydashboard

* See [here](https://github.com/nanxstats/awesome-shiny-extensions) for a mostly comprehensive list

* Consider themeing shiny apps with [{shinythemes}](https://rstudio.github.io/shinythemes/) and dashboards with [{dashboardthemes}](https://github.com/nik01010/dashboardthemes)

* Consider themeing figures to match your shiny theme with [{thematic}](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/)

# reactivity

---
# What is it?
* What you've been doing when writing shiny code

--

* Specify a graph of dependencies 

  + When an input changes, all related output is updated


---
# Inputs 

* `input` is basically a list object that contains objects from the ui

--

```{r eval = FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  numericInput("count", label = "Number of values", value = 100)
)
```

After writing this code, `input$count` will be a available in the server, and the value it takes will depend on the browser input (starting at 100)


--
These are read-only, and cannot be modified


---
# Selective read permissions
It must be in a reactive context, or it won't work. 


--
That's why this results in an error

```{r eval = FALSE}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  print(paste0("The value of input$count is ", input$count))
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
# > Error in .getReactiveEnvironment()$currentContext() : 
# >  Operation not allowed without an active reactive context. 
# > (You tried to do something that can only be done from inside a reactive expression or observer.)
```

---
# Output

* The `output` object is similar to `input`, in terms of being a list-like object.

* Create new components of the list for new output, and refer to them in the UI

* These also need to be in reactive contexts (e.g., `render*`)


---
# Simple example

.footnote[From [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-reactivity.html#reactive-programming)]

Try this app. Type the letters in one at a time. Notice how it updates.

```{r eval = FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput("name", "What's your name?"),
  textOutput("greeting")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$greeting <- renderText({
    paste0("Hello ", input$name, "!")
  })
}
```

---
# Programming style
* Notice you don't have to "run" the code each time the input updates

* Your app provides instructions to R. Shiny decides when it actually runs the code.


--
### This is known as declarative programming


--
Normal R code is *imperative* programming - you decide when it's run. Declarative programming means you provide instructions, but don't actually run it.


--
> you describe your overall goals, and the software figures out how to achieve them

# Reactive graph

.footnote[image from [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-reactivity.html#the-reactive-graph)]

* Normally, you understand R code by running it top to bottom

* This doesn't work with shiny

* Instead, we think through reactive graphs

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/056990a803a41501e2dbe05df351f8b8f7b493ab/f773a/diagrams/basic-reactivity/graph-1b.png)

# [reactlog](https://rstudio.github.io/reactlog/)

![](http://rstudio.github.io/reactlog/readme-images/pythagoras.gif)

---
# Basic example

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(reactlog)

reactlog_enable()

ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput("name", "What's your name?"),
  textOutput("greeting")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$greeting <- renderText({
    paste0("Hello ", input$name, "!")
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)

# close app, then
reactlogShow()
```

---
# Why reactivity?

Imagine we want to have a simple app converting temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius


--
Do this with variables

```{r }
temp_f <- 72
temp_c <- (temp_f - 32) * (5/9)
temp_c
```

--
But changing `temp_f` has no impact on `temp_c`

```{r }
temp_f <- 50
temp_c
```

---
# Use a function?
Let's instead make this a function that depends on the object in the global environment.

```{r }
to_celsius <- function() {
  (temp_f - 32) * (5/9)
}
to_celsius()
temp_f <- 30
to_celsius()
```

--
This works, but it's less than ideal computationally. 

Even if `temp_f` hasn't changed, the conversion is re-computed

--
Not a big deal in this case, but often is.


---
# Reactive alternative

First create a reactive variable

```{r }
library(shiny)
reactiveConsole(TRUE)
temp_f <- reactiveVal(72)
temp_f()
temp_f(50)
temp_f()
```

---
# Reactive function
Next create a reactive function

```{r }
to_celsius <- reactive({
  message("Converting...")
  (temp_f() - 32) * (5/9)
})
```

--

Now it will convert **only** when the value of `temp_f()` changes

---
```{r }
to_celsius()
to_celsius()

temp_f(100)
to_celsius()
to_celsius()
```


--
Unless the value of `temp_f` changes, the code will not be re-run.

# Some shiny best practices

> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand. â€” Martin Fowler

---
# Things to consider

.footnote[From [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/best-practices.html)]

* Are variable/function names clear and concise?

* Is code commented, where needed?

* Is there a way to break up complex functions?

* Are there many instances of copy/pasting?

* Can I manage different components of my app independently? Or are they too tangled together?

---
# Functions

### Something new I learned

Last time I showed you how to `source()` files. It turns out you don't need to do this!

* Create a new folder, `R/`

* Place `.R` files in that folder

* shiny will source them automatically!!

---
# UI example

.footnote[Example from [Mastering Shiny]()]

Imagine we have a bunch of different sliders we want to create. We could do something like this:

```{r }
ui <- fluidRow(
  sliderInput("alpha", "alpha", min = 0, max = 1, value = 0.5, step = 0.1),
  sliderInput("beta",  "beta",  min = 0, max = 1, value = 0.5, step = 0.1),
  sliderInput("gamma", "gamma", min = 0, max = 1, value = 0.5, step = 0.1),
  sliderInput("delta", "delta", min = 0, max = 1, value = 0.5, step = 0.1)
)
```


--
Ideas on how you could write a function to reduce the amount of code here?

---
# Slider function

```{r }
my_slider <- function(id) {
  sliderInput(id, id, min = 0, max = 1, value = 0.5, step = 0.1)
}
ui <- fluidRow(
  my_slider("alpha"),
  my_slider("beta"),
  my_slider("gamma"),
  my_slider("delta")
)
```

--
Anyway to make this even less repetitive?

---
# Loop through the ids

```{r }
ids <- c("alpha", "beta", "gamma", "delta")
sliders <- map(ids, my_slider)
ui <- fluidRow(sliders)
```

---
# Other use cases

* Maybe you want to use a shiny function, but assign it with some standard formatting
  - e.g., icons

* Maybe there are functions where you only want to change 1-3 things? Create a function that allows you to modify those, but keep other things at the values you want

---
# Server functions

* I often find it helpful to create functions for output, even if I'm not repeating them a lot
  + Can help keep server code clean and concise
  
* Inspect your code and consider refactoring in a similar way you would standard functions

* Consider keeping these in a separate `.R` file from your UI functions

# shiny modules
(briefly)

---
# What is a module?

* Allows you to modularize parts of your shiny app

* This can help "de-tangle" these pices from the rest of the app

* Primarily useful when the thing you want to modularize spans *both* the UI and the server

---
# Example
### No modules

.footnote[From [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-modules.html)]

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/051011ce1a1bc8989ae41b735b05b607b2ebde65/2e519/diagrams/scaling-modules/before.png)


---
# Example
### Same app, but with modules

.footnote[From [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-modules.html)]

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3d9a229fec717ef7bfda8e17a9c9d4fdc66b8b08/953f7/diagrams/scaling-modules/after.png)

---
# Create modules

* It's fairly complicated. See the [chapter](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-modules.html) from Mastering Shiny on the topic

* Probably not worth it until you're creating complicated apps, but I wanted to make you aware of them

---
# Conclusions
* Shiny is super customizable - almost limitless (see more examples [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/))

* Great for building interactive plots, but you can use it for all sorts of other things too (including text and tables)

* Really helpful and fun way to build data tools for practitioners

* Takes some practice, but basically allows you to write normal R code, and get interactive websites

---
# Any time left?

### Challenge

* Create a shiny app or shiny dashboard with the `palmerpenguins` dataset

* Allow the x and y axis to be selected by the user
  + These should be any numeric variables
  
* Allow the points to be colored by any categorical variable

  + For an added challenge, try to add in a "no color" option, which should be the default
