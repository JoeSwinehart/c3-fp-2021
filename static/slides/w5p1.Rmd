# Agenda
* Finish up slides from last week

* Discuss `map2_*` and `pmap_*`


---
# Learning objectives
* Understand the differences between `map`, `map2`, and `pmap`

# A few Examples
Basic simulations - iterating over two vectors

Plots by month, changing the title

---
# Simulation
* Simulate data from a normal distribution

	+ Vary $n$ from 5 to 150 by increments of 5
	
--
	
	+ For each $n$, vary $mu$ from -2 to 2 by increments of 0.25


--
### How do we get all combinations

--
`expand.grid`

---
# Example `expand.grid`
### Bonus: It turns it into a data frame!
```{r expand.grid}
ints <- 1:3
lets <- c("a", "b", "c")
expand.grid(ints, lets)
```

---
# Set conditions

Please follow along

```{r sim-conditions}
conditions <- expand.grid(n = seq(5, 150, 5),
                          mu = seq(-2, 2, 0.25))
head(conditions)
tail(conditions)
```

---
# Simulate!

```{r sim1}
sim1 <- map2(conditions$n, conditions$mu, ~{
  rnorm(n = .x, mean = .y, sd = 10)
})
str(sim1)
```

---
# More powerful
### Add it as a list column!

```{r list-column-sim1}
sim2 <- conditions %>%
  as_tibble() %>% # Not required, but definitely helpful
  mutate(sim = map2(n, mu, ~rnorm(n = .x, mean = .y, sd = 10))) 
sim2
```

---
# Unnest

```{r list-column-sim2}
conditions %>%
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(sim = map2(n, mu, ~rnorm(.x, .y, sd = 10))) %>%
  unnest(sim)
```

---
# Challenge

Can you replicate what we just did, but using a `rowwise()` approach?

`r countdown::countdown(3)`

--
```{r }
conditions %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(sim = list(rnorm(n, mu, sd = 10))) %>% 
  unnest(sim)
```

# Save all plots

We'll have to iterate across at least two things: (a) file path/names, and (b)
the plots themselves


--
We can do this with the `map()` family, but instead we'll use a different function, which we'll talk about more next week.


--
As an aside, what are the **steps** we would need to take to do this?


--
Could we use a `nest_by()` solution?

---
# Try with `nest_by()`

You try first:
* Create a vector of file paths
* "loop" through the file paths and the plots to save them

`r countdown::countdown(4)`

---
# Example

### Create a directory
```{r create_dir}
fs::dir_create(here::here("plots", "pulitzers"))
```

--
### Create file paths
```{r create_file-paths}
files <- str_replace_all(tolower(final_plots$newspaper), " ", "-")
paths <- here::here("plots", "pulitzers", glue("{files}.png"))
paths
```

---
# Add paths to data frame
```{r }
final_plots %>% 
  ungroup() %>% #<<
  mutate(path = paths) %>% 
  select(plots, path)
```

---
# Save
```{r }
final_plots %>% 
  ungroup() %>% #<<
  mutate(path = paths) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% #<<
  summarize(
    ggsave(
      path, 
      plots, 
      width = 9.5, 
      height = 6.5,
      dpi = 500
    )
  )
```

---
# Wrap-up
* Parallel iterations greatly increase the things you can do - iterating through at least two things simultaneously is pretty common


--
* The `nest_by()` approach can regularly get you the same result as `group_by() %>% nest() %>% mutate() %>% map()`

  + Caveat - must be in a data frame, which means working with list columns
  
--
* My view - it's still worth learning both. Looping with **{purrr}** is super flexible and often safer than base versions (type safe). Doesn't have to be used within a data frame.
