# Agenda

* Quick looping review

* Review functions

* A shiny challenge
  + But first, a brief discussion on publishing shiny apps

---
class: inverse-red middle
# Quick looping review

---
# Scenario

* Let's say you want to `scale()` (standardize) every numeric column in a data frame.


--
Use `palmerpenguins::penguins()` for our example.

```{r }
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins
```

---
# For loop method

You try first. Can you write a `for` loop that loops through each column and applies `scale()` if it's numeric?

`r countdown::countdown(2)`


---
One approach

```{r }
penguins2 <- penguins
for(i in seq_along(penguins2)) {
  if (is.numeric(penguins2[ ,i, drop = TRUE])) {
    penguins2[ ,i] <- scale(penguins2[ ,i])
  }
}
```

---
```{r }
penguins2
```

---
# Replicate with `lapply()`?

`r countdown::countdown(2)`

---
```{r }
penguins3 <- penguins
data.frame(
  lapply(penguins3, function(x) {
    if(is.numeric(x)) {
      x <- scale(x)
    }
    x
  })
)
```

---
# {purrr}

When do we use `~`?

Remember, `purrr::map()` is *exactly* like `base::lapply()`, except for the shortcut syntax


--
`~` is a shortcut for `function(.x)`

---
# Equivalent
The following are the same

.pull-left[

```{r }
map_df(penguins, ~{
  if(is.numeric(.x)) {
    .x <- scale(.x)
  }
  .x
})
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r }
map_df(penguins, function(.x) {
  if(is.numeric(.x)) {
    .x <- scale(.x)
  }
  .x
})
```

]

---
# Whe to use `~`?

You can use it whenever you feel comfortable, including always. You can also just loop a function through, and pass additional arguments to that function, e.g., 

```{r warning = FALSE}
map_dbl(penguins, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
map_dbl(penguins, ~mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE))
```

---
The `~ .x` syntax is also helpful for more complex things

```{r }
map_dbl(penguins, ~ifelse(
    is.numeric(.x), 
    mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE), 
    0
  )
)
```

# Functions review

---
# Remember

* Everything is a function


--
The following are equivalent

```{r}
3 + 5
```


```{r plus-fun}
`+`(3, 5)
``` 

---
# Using functions

* Most functions are bound to a name, e.g., `mean()`


--
* Anonymous functions are also common 

  + Apply the function in a loop, and it only ever exists in the loop
  

--
* You can also store functions in lists

  + Helpful if you want to apply lots of operations to a single vector

---
# Binding to a name

* Let's create a function that takes two arguments: (a) a data frame, and (b) the name of a discrete/categorical variable/column in the data frame.

* The function should return the count of each "level" in the categorical variable.

* For a small added challenge, have it optionally add the proportion

--
Example:

```{r echo = FALSE}
get_counts <- function(df, col, include_proportion = FALSE) {
  splt <- split(df, df[[col]])
  n_by <- vapply(splt, nrow, FUN.VALUE = integer(1))
  
  counts <- data.frame(
    col = names(n_by),
    count = n_by
  )
  
  names(counts)[1] <- col
  rownames(counts) <- NULL
  
  if (include_proportion) {
    counts$proportion <- n_by / sum(n_by)
  }
  counts
}
```

Example output with `palmerpenguins::penguins`.

.pull-left[
```{r echo = FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
get_counts(penguins, "species")
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r echo = FALSE}
get_counts(penguins, "species", TRUE)
```
]


---
# You try first 

Test it out with the **palmerpenguins** dataset. Do you get the same results I did?

Note - the example I used included only base R functions. You can feel free to use **dplyr** or whatevs, just be careful with NSE.

You also don't have to return a data frame output - return it however you want

`r countdown::countdown(7)`

---
# Where to start?

~~write a function~~

* Solve the problem for one example, generalize it to a function.


--
Use the **palmerpenguins** dataset *for* your example!


--
```{r }
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins
```

---
# How do you want to solve it?
Lots of ways, here's a base method

--
* First, split by species

```{r }
splt <- split(penguins, penguins$species)
```

--
* Next, count how many rows (observations) in each split

```{r }
sapply(splt, nrow)
```

--
Could go on, but this is basically the output.

---
# Wrap in a function

* What will the arguments be?


--
The data frame and the column

```{r }
get_counts <- function(df, column) {
  
}
```


--
What will the body be?

---
# Same as before
Just swap out the code for the arguments. Notice I'm indexing the columns differently. Why?

I'm also swapping out `sapply()` for `vapply()` to be a little more safe.

```{r }
get_counts <- function(df, column) {
  splt <- split(df, df[[column]])
  vapply(splt, nrow, FUN.VALUE = integer(1))
}
```

---
# Test it

```{r }
get_counts(penguins, "species")
get_counts(penguins, "island")
```

---
# Extensions
Let's say we want a data frame as the output.

Can you modify what we have now to make that so?

`r countdown::countdown(3)`

---
# Data frame

```{r }
get_counts <- function(df, column) {
  splt <- split(df, df[[column]])
  counts <- vapply(splt, nrow, FUN.VALUE = integer(1))
  
  tibble::tibble(
    var_levels = names(counts), # could use names(splt)
    count = counts
  )
}
```

---
# Test it

```{r }
get_counts(penguins, "species")
get_counts(penguins, "island")
```

---
# Column name

Can we make the output from the data frame have the same column that we fed it?

`r countdown::countdown(2)`

--

```{r }
get_counts <- function(df, column) {
  splt <- split(df, df[[column]])
  counts <- vapply(splt, nrow, FUN.VALUE = integer(1))
  
  d <- tibble::tibble(
    var_levels = names(counts), # could use names(splt)
    count = counts
  )
  names(d)[1] <- column #<<
  d
}
```

---
# Test it

```{r }
get_counts(penguins, "species")
get_counts(penguins, "island")
```


---
# {dplyr} version

Can we replicate this function using dplyr?

We'll have to use non-standard evaluation


--

First, solve it on a use case

```{r }
penguins %>% 
  count(species)
```

---
# Function

Will this work?

```{r }
get_counts <- function(df, column) {
  df %>% 
    count(column)
}
```


--
```{r error = TRUE}
get_counts(penguins, species)
```

---
# Use NSE

```{r}
get_counts <- function(df, column) {
  df %>% 
    count({{column}})
}
```

--
```{r }
get_counts(penguins, species)
get_counts(penguins, island)
```

---
# Pass the dots

Alternatively, you could just pass the dots

Bonus, this will now give you the counts for multiple columns


--
```{r }
get_counts <- function(df, ...) {
  df %>% 
    count(...)
}
```

---
# Test it

```{r }
get_counts(penguins, species)
get_counts(penguins, species, island)
```

---
# Conditions

* Let's add a condition that optionally reports the proportions in addition to the counts.


--
* What will be the first step?


--
* Add a new argument (and consider setting defaults for that argument)


--
```{r }
get_counts <- function(df, column, return_proportions = FALSE) {
  df %>% 
    count({{column}})
}
```

---
# Set conditional block
Create a block for operations to conduct **when the condition is TRUE**

```{r }
get_counts <- function(df, column, return_proportions = FALSE) {
  counts <- df %>% 
    count({{column}})
  
  if (isTRUE(return_proportions)) {
    
  }
  counts
}
```

---
# Write condition
In the block, include the code that is only evaluated when the condition is `TRUE`.

```{r }
get_counts <- function(df, column, return_proportions = FALSE) {
  counts <- df %>% 
    count({{column}})
  
  if (isTRUE(return_proportions)) {
    counts <- counts %>% 
      mutate(proportion = n / sum(n))
  }
  counts
}
```

---
# Test it

```{r }
get_counts(penguins, species)
get_counts(penguins, species, return_proportions = TRUE)
```

---
# Challenge
Now that we have a basic function, can you write a **new** function that *calls this function* to add the proportions and/or counts to a data frame?

Should return the original data frame, but with the counts/proportions added in as a new column.

`r countdown::countdown(4)`

---
# One solution

```{r}
add_counts <- function(data, column, add_proportions = FALSE) {
  counts <- get_counts(data, {{column}}, add_proportions)
  left_join(data, counts)
}
```

---
# Test it out

I'm selecting variables after just so we can see the counts

```{r }
add_counts(penguins, species) %>% 
  select(species, island, n)
```

---
# Test it again

This time let's add the proportions

```{r }
add_counts(penguins, species, add_proportions = TRUE) %>% 
  select(species, island, n, proportion)
```


---
# Embed checks

Can you embed a warning or error (your choice) if the column fed to the function is not discrete?

Note - this is more difficult with our **dplyr** version. Try using `dplyr::pull()`.

`r countdown::countdown(3)`

---

```{r }
get_counts <- function(df, column, return_proportions = FALSE) {
  
  column_vec <- dplyr::pull(df, {{column}})
  
  if(is.numeric(column_vec)) {
    stop("Numeric column passed to function. Counts must be computed on categorical data.")
  }
  
  counts <- df %>% 
    count({{column}})
  
  if (isTRUE(return_proportions)) {
    counts <- counts %>% 
      mutate(proportion = n / sum(n))
  }
  counts
}
```

---
# Test it out
Note we can test it with either the `get_counts()` or `add_counts()` functions

```{r error = TRUE}
get_counts(penguins, bill_length_mm)
add_counts(penguins, bill_length_mm)
```

# Publishing
* We never talked about publishing shiny apps

See [here](https://statsandr.com/blog/how-to-publish-shiny-app-example-with-shinyapps-io/) for a nice step-by-step walkthrough for publishing with https://www.shinyapps.io/

--
Basically:
* Register an account with https://www.shinyapps.io/
* Add a token to your account on shinyapps
* Back locally, set your account info with the token and secret via 

```{r eval = FALSE}
rsconnect::setAccountInfo(
  name = "myaccount", # replace with your account name
  token = "mytokencopiedfromshinyappsio", # your token
  secret = "mysecretcopiedfromshinyappsio"
)
```

# Shiny app
* Create a shiny app or shiny dashboard with the `palmerpenguins` dataset

* Allow the x and y axis to be selected by the user
  + Only numeric variables should be available to be selected
  
* Allow the points to be colored by any categorical variable

  + For an added challenge, try to add in a "no color" option, which should be the default

Once you've gone this far, try to publish your app. If you're successful, continue with challenge on next slide

---
# Challenge continued

* Add a table to the app that reports descriptive data on the columns that are selected in the plot
  + e.g., `n()`, `mean()`, `sd()`
  
* Use tabs so the plot shows up in one tab, and the table shows up in a different tab

Now publish again to update it
